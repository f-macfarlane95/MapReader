MapReader's ``Download`` subpackage is used to download maps stored on as XYZ tile layers on a tile server.
It contains two classes for downloading maps:

- :ref:`SheetDownloader` - This can be used to download map sheets and relies on information provided in a metadata ``json`` file.
- :ref:`Downloader` - This is used to download maps using polygons and can be used even if you don't have a metadata ``json`` file.

MapReader uses XYZ tile layers (also known as 'slippy map tile layers') to download map tiles.

In an XYZ tile layer, each tile in is indexed by it's zoom level (Z) and grid coordinates (X and Y).
These tiles can be downloaded using an XYZ download url (this normally looks something like "https://mapseries-tilesets.your_URL_here/{z}/{x}/{y}.png").

Regardless of which class you will use to download your maps, you must know the XYZ URL of your map tile layer.

.. _SheetDownloader:

SheetDownloader
---------------

To download map sheets, you must provide MapReader with a metadata file (usually a ``json`` file), which contains information about your map sheets.
Guidance on what this metadata ``json`` should contain can be found in our :doc:`Input Guidance </Input-guidance>`.
An example is shown below:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [{
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "geometry_name": "the_geom",
                "coordinates": [...]
            },
            "properties": {
                "IMAGE": "101602026",
                "WFS_TITLE": "Nottinghamshire III.NE, Revised: 1898, Published: 1900",
                "IMAGEURL": "https://maps.nls.uk/view/101602026",
                "YEAR": 1900
            },
        }],
        "crs": {
            "name": "EPSG:4326"
            },
    }

.. todo:: explain what json file does (allows splitting layer into 'map sheets'), allows patches to retain attributes of parent maps to investigate at any point of pipeline (Katie)

To set up your sheet downloader, you should first create a ``SheetDownloader`` instance, specifying a ``metadata_path`` (the path to your ``metadata.json`` file) and ``download_url`` (the URL for your XYZ tile layer).
This is done using:

.. code-block:: python

     from mapreader import SheetDownloader

     my_ts = SheetDownloader(
         metadata_path="path/to/metadata.json",
         download_url="mapseries-tilesets.your_URL_here/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
     )

e.g. for the OS one-inch maps:

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts = SheetDownloader(
         metadata_path="~/MapReader/mapreader/worked_examples/persistent_data/metadata_OS_One_Inch_GB_WFS_light.json",
         download_url="https://mapseries-tilesets.s3.amazonaws.com/1inch_2nd_ed/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
     )

To help you visualize your metadata, the boundaries of the map sheets included in your metadata can be visualized using:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.plot_all_metadata_on_map()

.. image:: ../figures/plot_metadata_on_map.png
     :width: 400px
     :align: center



The ``add_id`` argument can be used to add the WFS ID numbers of your map sheets on the resulting plot.
This can be helpful in identifying the map sheets you'd like to download.

It can also be helpful to know the range of publication dates for your map sheets.
This can be done using the ``.extract_published_dates()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.extract_published_dates()

By default, this will extract publication dates from the ``"WFS_TITLE"`` field of your metadata (see example metadata.json above).
If you would like to extract the dates from elsewhere, you can specify the ``date_col`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.extract_published_dates(date_col=["properties", "YEAR"])

This will extract published dates from the ``"YEAR"`` field of your metadata (again, see example metadata.json above).

.. note:: If your metadata.json is a multilayer dictionary, you will need to pass the key for each layer as a separate item in list form.

These dates can then be visualized, as a histogram, using:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.hist_published_dates()


Your ``SheetDownloader`` instance (``my_ts``) can be used to query and download map sheets using a number of methods:

**1. Any which are within or intersect/overlap with a polygon.
1. Any which contain a set of given coordinates.
2. Any which intersect with a line.
3. By WFS ID numbers.
4. By searching for a string within a metadata field.**

These methods can be used to either directly download maps, or to create a list of queries which can interacted with and downloaded subsequently.

.. _query_guidance:

Query guidance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all query methods, you should be aware of the following arguments:

- ``append`` - By default, this is set to ``False`` and so a new query list is created each time you make a new query. Setting it to ``True`` (i.e. by specifying ``append=True``) will result in your newly query results being appended to your previous ones.
- ``print`` - By default, this is set to ``False`` and so query results will not be printed when you run the query method. Setting it to ``True`` will result in your query results being printed.

You should also be aware of:

- The ``.get_minmax_latlon()`` method, which will print out the minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes of all your map sheets and can help you identify valid ranges of latitudes and longitudes to use for querying. It's use is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.get_minmax_latlon()

- The ``.print_found_queries()`` method, which can be used to print your query results at any time. It's use is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.print_found_queries()

.. note:: You can also set ``print=True`` in the query commands to print your results in situ. See above.

- The ``.plot_queries_on_map()`` method, which can be used to plot your query results on a map. As with the ``.plot_all_metadata_on_map()``, you can specify ``add_id=True`` to add the WFS ID numbers to your plot. Use this method as follows:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.plot_queries_on_map()

.. _download_guidance:

Download guidance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before downloading any maps, you will first need to specify the zoom level to use when downloading your tiles.
This is done using:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.get_grid_bb()

By default, this will use ``zoom_level=14``.

If you would like to use a different zoom level, use the ``zoom_level`` argument:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.get_grid_bb(zoom_level=16)

.. note:: The higher the zoom level, the more detailed your maps will be (and so the larger the file size). MapReader will raise a warning if you are downloading more than 100MB of data, to bypass this you will need to add ``force=True`` when calling the function to download your maps.

For all download methods, you should also be aware of the following arguments:

- ``path_save`` - By default, this is set to ``maps`` so that your map images and metadata are saved in a directory called "maps". You can change this to save your map images and metadata in a different directory (e.g. ``path_save="my_maps_directory"``).
- ``metadata_fname`` - By default, this is set to ``metadata.csv``. You can change this to save your metadata with a different file name (e.g. ``metadata_fname="my_maps_metadata.csv"``).
- ``overwrite`` - By default, this is set to ``False`` and so if a map image exists already, the download is skipped and map images are not overwritten. Setting it to ``True`` (i.e. by specifying ``overwrite=True``) will result in existing map images being overwritten.
- ``date_col`` - The key(s) to use when extracting the publication dates from your metadata.json.
- ``metadata_to_save`` - A dictionary containing information about the metadata you'd like to transfer from your metadata.json to your metadata.csv. See below for further details.
- ``force`` - If you are downloading more than 100MB of data, you will need to confirm that you would like to download this data by setting ``force=True``.

Using the default ``path_save`` and ``metadata_fname`` arguments will result in the following directory structure:

::

    project
    ├──your_notebook.ipynb
    └──maps
        ├── map1.png
        ├── map2.png
        ├── map3.png
        ├── ...
        └── metadata.csv

By default, your metadata.csv file will only contain the following columns:

- "name"
- "url"
- "coordinates"
- "crs"
- "published_date"
- "grid_bb"

If you would like to transfer additional data from your metadata.json to you metadata.csv, you should create a dictionary containing the names of the fields you would like to save and pass this as the ``metadata_to_save`` keyword argument in each download method.

This should be in the form of:

.. code-block:: python

     metadata_to_save = {
          "new_column_name_1": ["metadata_key_layer_1"],
          "new_column_name_2": ["metadata_key_layer_1", "metadata_key_layer_2"],
          ...
     }

For example, to save the "WFS_TITLE" field from the example metadata.json above, you would use:

.. code-block:: python

     metadata_to_save = {
          "wfs_title": ["properties", "WFS_TITLE"],
     }

This would result in a metadata.csv with the following columns:

- "name"
- "url"
- "coordinates"
- "crs"
- "published_date"
- "grid_bb"
- "wfs_title"

1. Finding map sheets which overlap or intersect with a polygon.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_polygon()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_polygon()`` methods can be used find and download map sheets which are within or intersect/overlap with a `shapely.Polygon <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon>`_.
These methods have two modes:

- "within" - This finds map sheets whose bounds are completely within the given polygon.
- "intersects" - This finds map sheets which intersect/overlap with the given polygon.

The ``mode`` can be selected by specifying ``mode="within"`` or ``mode="intersects"``.

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_polygon()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_polygon()`` methods take a `shapely.Polygon <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon>`_ object as the ``polygon`` argument.
These polygons can be created using MapReader's ``create_polygon_from_latlons()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

     from mapreader import create_polygon_from_latlons

     my_polygon = create_polygon_from_latlons(min_lat, min_lon, max_lat, max_lon)

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_polygon = create_polygon_from_latlons(54.3, -3.2, 56.0, 3)

Then, to find map sheets which fall within the bounds of this polygon, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_polygon(my_polygon, mode="within")

Or, to find map sheets which intersect with this polygon, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_polygon(my_polygon, mode="intersects")

.. note:: Guidance on how to view/visualize your query results can be found in query_guidance_.

To download your query results, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_queries()

By default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: Further information on the use of the download methods can be found in download_guidance_.

Alternatively, you can bypass the querying step and download map sheets directly using the ``download_map_sheets_by_polygon()`` method.

To download map sheets which fall within the bounds of this polygon, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_polygon(my_polygon, mode="within")

Or, to find map sheets which intersect with this polygon, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_polygon(my_polygon, mode="intersects")

Again, by default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: As with the ``download_map_sheets_by_queries()`` method, see download_guidance_ for further guidance.

1. Finding map sheets which contain a set of coordinates.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_coordinates()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_coordinates()`` methods can be used find and download map sheets which contain a set of coordinates.

To find maps sheets which contain a given set of coordinates, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_coordinates((x_coord, y_coord))

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_coordinates((-2.2, 53.4))

.. note:: Guidance on how to view/visualize your query results can be found in query_guidance_.

To download your query results, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_queries()

By default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: Further information on the use of the download methods can be found in download_guidance_.

Alternatively, you can bypass the querying step and download map sheets directly using the ``download_map_sheets_by_coordinates()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_polygon((x_coord, y_coord))

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_coordinates((-2.2, 53.4))

Again, by default, these will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: As with the ``download_map_sheets_by_queries()`` method, see download_guidance_ for further guidance.

3. Finding map sheets which intersect with a line.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_line()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_line()`` methods can be used find and download map sheets which intersect with a line.

These methods take a `shapely.LineString <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.LineString.html#shapely.LineString>`_ object as the ``line`` argument.
These lines can be created using MapReader's ``create_line_from_latlons()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

     from mapreader import create_line_from_latlons

     my_line = create_line_from_latlons((lat1, lon1), (lat2, lon2))

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_line = create_line_from_latlons((54.3, -3.2), (56.0, 3))

Then, to find maps sheets which intersect with your line, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_coordinates(my_line)

.. note:: Guidance on how to view/visualize your query results can be found in query_guidance_.

To download your query results, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_queries()

By default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: Further information on the use of the download methods can be found in download_guidance_.

Alternatively, you can bypass the querying step and download map sheets directly using the ``download_map_sheets_by_line()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_polygon(my_line)

Again, by default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: As with the ``download_map_sheets_by_queries()`` method, see download_guidance_ for further guidance.

4. Finding map sheets using their WFS ID numbers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids()`` methods can be used find and download map sheets using their WFS ID numbers.

To find maps sheets using their WFS ID numbers, use:

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids(2)

or

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids([2,15,31])

.. note:: Guidance on how to view/visualize your query results can be found in query_guidance_.

To download your query results, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_queries()

By default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: Further information on the use of the download methods can be found in download_guidance_.

Alternatively, you can bypass the querying step and download map sheets directly using the ``download_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids(2)

or

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_wfs_ids([2,15,31])

Again, by default, these will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: As with the ``download_map_sheets_by_queries()`` method, see download_guidance_ for further guidance.

5. Finding map sheets by searching for a string in their metadata.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``.query_map_sheets_by_string()`` and ``download_map_sheets_by_string()`` methods can be used find and download map sheets by searching for a string in their metadata.

These methods use `regex string searching <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__ to find map sheets whose metadata contains a given string.
Wildcards and regular expressions can therefore be used in the ``string`` argument.

To find maps sheets whose metadata contains a given string, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_string("my search string")

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.query_map_sheets_by_string("n?don")

.. note:: Guidance on how to view/visualize your query results can be found in query_guidance_.

.. admonition:: Advanced usage
    :class: dropdown

    By default the ``keys`` argument is set to ``None``, meaning that this method will search for your string in **all** metadata fields.

    You can, however, specify the ``keys`` argument to search within a specific metadata field.
    e.g. to search in ``features["properties"]["WFS_TITLE"]``, you should use ``keys=["properties", "WFS_TITLE"]``.

To download your query results, use:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_queries()

By default, this will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: Further information on the use of the download methods can be found in download_guidance_.

Alternatively, you can bypass the querying step and download map sheets directly using the ``download_map_sheets_by_string()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_string("my search string")

e.g. :

.. code-block:: python

     #EXAMPLE
     my_ts.download_map_sheets_by_string("*shire")

Again, by default, these will result in the directory structure shown in download_guidance_.

.. note:: As with the ``download_map_sheets_by_queries()`` method, see download_guidance_ for further guidance.
