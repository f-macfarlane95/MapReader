.. todo:: Add a bit of text explaining format of user guide.
.. todo:: Explain what the user guide is for vs worked examples

This User Guide provides guidance to all users of MapReader on how to use the MapReader package.
We have tried to split our guide logically, into smaller sub-tasks, which may be used as part of an end-to-end run of the MapReader pipeline (detailed :doc:`here </About>`).

Throughout this User Guide, we will use OS maps as examples.
**These are provided for illustrative purposes only.**

Please read this User Guide **before** looking through the worked examples.
