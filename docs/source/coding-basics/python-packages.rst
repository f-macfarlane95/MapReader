Python packages
===============

A Python package is a collection of modules bundled together, which can be reused across various projects.
Unlike programs or apps that you can click and find in your start page or launch pad, Python packages are typically used within your code and usually do not have a graphical user interface (GUI).

Common Uses of Python Packages
------------------------------

Python packages are used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Data analysis**: Packages like ``pandas`` and ``numpy`` are commonly used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Web development**: Packages like ``flask`` and ``django`` are used for building web applications.
- **Machine learning**: Packages like ``scikit-learn`` and ``tensorflow`` are used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- **Scientific computing**: Packages like ``scipy`` and ``matplotlib`` are used for scientific computing and data visualization.
- **Utilities**: Packages like ``requests`` and ``beautifulsoup4`` are used for web scraping and interacting with web APIs.
- ...and more!

Installing Python Packages
--------------------------

Python packages can be installed using the ``pip`` package manager, which comes pre-installed with Python.
To install a package, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install <package_name>

For instance, to install the ``pandas`` package, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pandas

You can also install multiple packages at once by separating them with spaces:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

For more information on using ``pip``, you can refer to the `official documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/>`_.
Once a package is installed, you can import it into your Python code using the `import` statement:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas

This will allow you to use the functions and classes provided by the package in
your code.
