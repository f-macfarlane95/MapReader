MapReader Ways of Working
=========================

This document outlines expectations and responsibilities with regard to working
on the project.

Commitments
-----------

All MapReader project members commit to:

- making the implicit explicit by clearly documenting their work
- following the contribution guidelines and ensuring they are kept up to date
- recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project
  management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- dedicating their time and expertise in fixing open issues either directly via
  GitHub or providing mentorship and support to community members and project
  contributors
- provide feedback on MapReader by opening issues in the MapReader GitHub
  repository
- documenting and sharing any conversation from closed spaces (such as email,
  Slack or 1:1 meeting) in a GitHub issue that could be useful for the
  community or community members in enabling their work in MapReader

Communication
-------------

You can reach out to any member by tagging them on GitHub issues or Pull
Requests.

You can reach the lead investigators of the project through their preferred way
of communication: You can mention Katie McDonough `@kmcdono2 <https://github.com/kmcdono2>`_
on a Github issue. You can also contact Katie by emailing
`kmcdonough@lancaster.ac.uk <mailto:kmcdonough@lancaster.ac.uk>`_.

Project management
-------------------

The project members triage on open issues, review Pull Requests or address any
questions raised on GitHub asynchronously.

As most members do not work full time on MapReader, it might take some time
until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge
is needed. Don't be afraid to nudge if they've not replied after a few days!

Issues & Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project members will:

- monitor open issues and Pull Requests on the project's GitHub repository to
  identify if feedback, comment or connections can help address any concern or
  build on any suggested ideas/features.
- whenever possible, post about the issues and Pull Requests in public forums
  (newsletter, Slack, Twitter) to facilitate participation from new members in
  the community.
- review or assign a reviewer to open Pull Requests for review. This should be
  taken as an opportunity to connect contributors with specific interests,
  availability or technical skills that could be useful for the ongoing work.
- connect issues and Pull Requests where possible (for example, by mentioning
  'Fixes #[issue number]' in the Pull Request description). By adding "closes
  #issue" or `something similar <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords>`_
  in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue
  automatically.
- once completed, approve Pull Requests (for the contributors to merge them)
  and/or close issues immediately (if not linked to specific Pull Request) with
  a comment describing how it was addressed.
- when reviewing a pull request or commenting on issues, be specific, describe
  your ideas clearly, comment to request changes or make a pull request to the
  file that should be merged (please do not use the "request changes" option
  when reviewing Pull Requests).
- use your interactions on GitHub or other community spaces to provide support,
  mentorship and acknowledgement to our community of contributors.
